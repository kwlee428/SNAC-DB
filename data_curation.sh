# Pipline explanation:
# This pipeline details the curation process for the SNAC-DB Pipeline
# Purpose of the pipeline is to extract all possible Ab/Nb complexes from a structure file
# Only required input is the path to the structure files
# There are two optional inputs: whether to show each step of the curation process and whether to get rid of redundant complexes
# default options are that the pipeline only outputs the final curated complexes and removes all redundant complexes

# Check if the input directory is provided as an argument
if [ -z "$1" ]; then
